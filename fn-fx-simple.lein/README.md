# fn-fx-simple.lein

This is a project that shows the problem while creating an fn-fx uberjar with lein.
My system setup is as follows:
Description:    Ubuntu 18.10
Release:        18.10
Codename:       cosmic

java -version
openjdk version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.1+13-Ubuntu-2ubuntu1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.1+13-Ubuntu-2ubuntu1, mixed mode, sharing)

## Usage

1. 'lein run' works in this project.
2. 'lein uberjar' just hangs
